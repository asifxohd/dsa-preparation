    Like a stack, the queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner.
    
    Operations associated with queue are: 

    Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition  Time Complexity : O(1)
    Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition  Time Complexity : O(1)
    Front: Get the front item from queue  Time Complexity : O(1)
    Rear: Get the last item from queue  Time Complexity : O(1)
